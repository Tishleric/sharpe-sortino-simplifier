  "explanation": "These are the expected values when using percentage data format. For percentage inputs like 2.5%, the value is converted to 0.025 for calculation, resulting in a mean return of 0.0235 (displayed as 2.35%). The annualized return is calculated using the compound formula which results in approximately 358% rather than the erroneously high 35,845%."
