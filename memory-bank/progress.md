# Project Progress

## What Works

- **Core Functionality**
  - File upload and parsing (CSV, Excel)
  - Data format detection and conversion
  - Sharpe and Sortino ratio calculations
  - Display of results with 4 decimal precision
  - Distribution visualization
  - Data export (CSV and Excel)

- **User Interface**
  - Three-step workflow: Upload → Configure → Results
  - Data preview with column selection
  - Parameter configuration
  - Results dashboard with tabs

- **Recent Enhancements**
  - Excel export now includes:
    - Inputs & Summary sheet with raw/fractional returns and parameters
    - Detailed Breakdown sheet showing all calculation steps
    - Methodology explanation sheet
    - Live Excel formulas that reference cells, not hardcoded values
    - Properly quoted sheet names in formulas for Excel compatibility
  - Fixed display of small values (e.g., downside deviation) by increasing decimals from 2 to 4
  - Improved histogram binning by splitting at zero, ensuring bins are definitively positive or negative
  - Ensured target return parameter defaults to 0 in Excel to prevent formula errors

## What's Left to Build

- **Potential Enhancements**
  - Support for more complex return series (irregular intervals)
  - Addition of other risk-adjusted metrics (e.g., Calmar ratio, Omega ratio)
  - Comparative analysis features for multiple data series
  - Enhanced visualization options

## Known Issues

- None currently—we've recently resolved:
  - Display issues with small decimal values
  - Excel formula errors with sheet name quoting
  - Histogram bin overlap at zero
  - Empty target return parameter causing Excel formula errors

## Technical Debt

- Consider updating the browserslist database (currently 7 months old)
